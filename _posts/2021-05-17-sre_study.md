## Books

### The Site Reliability Book

In a devops approach, you improve something (often by automating it), measure the results and share those results with colleagues so the whole organization can improve.

* **No more silos**
    * The first key idea is *o more silos*. This is a reaction to a couple ideas:
        * The historically popular but now increasingly old-fashioned arrangement of separate operations and development teams
        * The fact that extreme siliozation of knowledge, incentives for purely local optimization, and lack of collaboration have in many cases been actively bad for business.
* **Change Should be Gradual**
    * Build a steady pipeline of low-risk change out of regular output from product, design, and infrastructure changes. This strategy, coupled with automatic testing of smaller changes and reliable rollback of bad changes, leads to approaches to change management like CI/CD.
* **Tooling and Culture are Interrelated**
    * A good culture can work around broken tooling, but the opposite rarely holds true.
* **Measurement is Crucial**



> class SRE implements interface DevOps

* Operations is a Software Problem
* Manage by Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
* Work to minimize Toil
* Automate This Year's Job Away
* Move Fast by Reducing the Cost of Failure
    * reduced mean time to repair (MTTR)
* Share ownership with developers
    * SREs tend to be inclined to focus on production problems rather than business logic problems, but as their approach brings software engineering tools to bear on the problem, they share skill sets with product development teams. 
    * In general, SRE has particular expertise around the **availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning** of the service(s) they are looking after.
* Use the same tooling, regardless of function or job title

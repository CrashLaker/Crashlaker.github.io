    * You are designing solution for a company in xxx domain. Data is generated in xxx system at xxx rate, and you need to design a solution for xxx use case, at xxx constraint (latency, capacity, order of event data), and you need to prioritize cost/low maintenance/lack of technical skill. How would you design the solution?
        * One needs to have a good understanding of the various dimensions of characteristics of AWS services covered to answer these questions effectively. For example:
            * Latency: what services can achieve ~10 seconds latency? (Pop quiz: Can Kinese Data Streams do it? What about Data Firehose?) What about a minute / near real time? If I have X amount of on-prem data to move to AWS and I need it in y days, should I use Snowball or Direct Connect?

* AWS Kinesis Overview
    * Kinesis is a managed alternative to Apache Kafka
    * Great for application logs, metrics, IoT, clickstreams
    * Great for "real-time" big data
    * Great for streaming processing frameworks (spark, nifi)
    * Data is automatically replicated synchronously do 3 AZ
    * **Kinesis Streams**: low latency streaming ingest at scale
    * **Kinesis Analytics**: perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL
